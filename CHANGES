      - cn_rmaResult.rda (SKW)

2010-02-21 R. Scharpf - committed version 1.5.27
 
** additional support for ff in crlmm and computeCopynumber functions

2010-03-02 M. Ritchie - committed version 1.5.28
 * Added message to readIDAT() warning that older style IDAT files can not be read in.
Such files arise when scanner settings contain the line <GenerateVersionTwoIdatFiles>false</GenerateVersionTwoIdatFiles>
If this is modified to <GenerateVersionTwoIdatFiles>true</GenerateVersionTwoIdatFiles>, 
then readIDAT() should work. Thanks to Pierre Cherel who reported this error.
 * Removed AllClasses.R from Collate field in DESCRIPTION file (causes an error in build)

2010-03-05 M. Ritchie - committed version 1.5.29
 * crlmmIlluminaV2() now exported.  Added man page crlmmIlluminaV2.Rd

2010-03-07 R. Scharpf committed version 1.5.30

       - one can use ff in conjunction with affy platforms 5.0 and 6.0
       - preprocessing / genotyping is basically the same set of
        commands with either illumina/affy platforms (though
        illumina-users may have to play with some of the options for
        reading idat files
       - if ff package is loaded, the assayData elements are ff objects

       - the classes all inherit from 'CrlmmContainer' that contains
         an additional slot 'options' and 'genomeAnnotation'.  options
         is a list with the default arguments to snprma, crlmm, etc,
         as well as a few global settings such as 'verbose' and
         'seed'.  I added the genomeAnnotation slot simply because I
         want to be able to use ff-objects for the feature-level data.
         Maybe with setClassUnion we could avoid adding the
         genomeAnnotation slot (and use featureData instead), but I
         didn't have much success with this.

	 - the batchSize argument will run the genotyping (crlmmGT) in
           batches to reduce the RAM.  The default is batches of size
           1000.

	 - The crlmm.Rd file contains an example with / without ff
             for Affymetrix data.

2010-03-08 M. Ritchie committed version 1.5.31
