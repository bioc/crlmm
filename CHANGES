 * 100*CA, 100*CB are stored in the CA, CB assayDataElements.  The
   replacement method automatically converts a matrix on the copy
   number scale to an integer representation by scaling by a factor of
   100. The accessor methods for CA, CB automatically divide by 100 to
   return estimates back on the original copy number scale.

 * more debugging of readIdatFiles and illumina copy number vignette.

 * updated illumina_copynumber vignette

2009-10-25 M Ritchie - committed version 1.3.24

 * fixed bug in readIdatFiles()

 * fixed bug in harmonizeSnpSet and update function

2010-01-17 R. Scharpf committed version 1.4.3
 * updated the inst/scripts/copynumber.Rnw vignette and the corresponding pdf


2010-02-22 R. Scharpf committed version 1.4.5

 * the crlmm annotation packages for illumina uses 'X' and 'Y' instead
   of 23 and 24.  This results in the creation of a crlmmSetList
   object that has zero rows.  I modified the splitByChromosome
   function so that it checks for X and Y instead of the integer
   representation.
