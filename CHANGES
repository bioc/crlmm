* Added TODO file

* Added CHANGES file

* Reduced number of files in R/ by combining functions for a given methodology (crlmm / cnrma)

* Files with suffix XYZ-functions.R should have *functions* for methodology XYZ

* Files with suffix XYZ-methods.R should have *methods* for methodology XYZ

* Imported assayDataNew from Biobase

* Added inst/scripts to store vignettes that can't be built by BioC
due to the fact that they depend on external data not available as
BioC data packages

* Added crlmmSet class and calls/confs methods

2009-03-08 Benilton Carvalho <bcarvalh@jhsph.edu> - committed version 1.0.55

* Added biocViews

* Removed empty \details{} in cnrma.Rd

2009-03-14 Benilton Carvalho <bcarvalh@jhsph.edu> - committed version 1.0.56

* Loaded data in cnrma-functions.R to an environment and extracted from there
  so we can get rid of the NOTES complaining about 'no visible bindings'.

2009-03-18 Rob Scharpf <rscharpf@jhsph.edu> - committed version 1.0.57
* Added steps object to instantiateObjects to speed up debugging
* Reformulated the regression for chromosome X
   -  estimate cross-hybridization using chromosome X
* Take into account pseudo-autosomal regions on chr X for copy number estimation
* Replaced get() and assign() with '<-' operations to improve readability
* Function to compute posterior means of copy number estimates

2009-03-19 Rob Scharpf - committed version 1.0.59
* Requires genomewidesnp6Crlmm version 1.0.1 or greater

2009-03-25 Rob Scharpf - committed version 1.0.60
* simplified some of the preliminary steps for the computeCopynumber function
* crlmm output subset within the body of the function
* modified vignette -- store results in an oligoSnpSet object (for now)
* added function to extract the date from the celfile headers (celDates)

2009-03-25 Rob Scharpf - committed version 1.0.61
* update to copynumber vignette

2009-03-27 B Carvalho - committed version 1.0.62

* crlmm() returns a SnpSet object (from Biobase)

* fixed standard vignette to accommodate this change

* redefined calls/confs to accommodate this change

* fixed documentation to acommodate this change

2009-03-28 B Carvalho - committed version 1.0.64
* modified crlmm and cnrma to look for data at extdata/

2009-03-29 Rob Scharpf - committed version 1.0.65

* update to copynumber vignette

* updated computeCopynumber.Rd to accommodate SnpSet objects and
  changes to genomewidesnp6Crlmm

* cnrma function requires the cdfName

* update man files for cnrma and computeCopynumber

2009-03-30 Matt Ritchie - committed version 1.0.66

* added functions to read in idat files, pre-process and genotype 
data from Illumina SNP arrays (functions named readIdatFiles() 
and crlmmIllumina() in crlmm-illumina.R)
* added man pages for these functions

2009-04-01 Matt Ritchie - committed version 1.0.67

* added import statement for normalize.quantiles

2009-04-01 R.Scharpf - committed version 1.0.69

* added a few items to the crlmm TODOs

2009-04-03 B Carvalho - committed version 1.0.70

* Updated TODO and DESCRIPTION

2009-04-04 R.Scharpf - committed version 1.0.71

*  bug in oneBatch function for chromosome X.  added additional checks for missing values

2009-04-06 Matt Ritchie - committed version 1.0.72

* new argument in readIdatFiles() 'saveDate', which saves the date and time each array
is decoded and scanned
* results from crlmmIllumina() now saved as 'SnpSet' just like crlmm()
* reorganised Illumina preprocessing functions slightly to
  - allow copy number intensities to be saved along with snp intensities
  - make use of new indexing objects in the chip specific crlmm data packages
  - fix a few bugs

2009-04-07 Rob Scharpf - committed version 1.0.73

* added cdfName as argument to computeCopynumber

2009-04-07 B Carvalho - committed versioni 1.0.74

* Added documentation for snprma.

* Removed 'svn:executable' property of readIdatFiles.Rd
